# Physix2D
Physix2D is a 2D physics engine written to learn more about game physics.

If you want to use this engine, I recommend using [premake](https://github.com/premake/premake-core), Physix2D uses premake by default.

The test project can be found [here](https://github.com/Sigurd015/Hanabi/tree/physix2d)
